		"abstract":"Language is a hallmark of human cognition. It allows for efficient communication between humans and is a building block for high-level cognition. The question of how linguistic semantic meaning is represented in and produced by the brain is of great interest in cognitive neuroscience. Recently, a deep-learning model showed how next word prediction task gives rise to high order lingual capabilities. In my talk, I will present results linking this deep learning model as well as other concepts from deep learning with language, human behavior, and brain responses. Deep learning offers an alternative framework to understand language in general and the relation between language and the brain in particular. In my research, I collected intracranial neural responses in two central instances of natural language processing: (1) listening to stories, and (2) engaging in real-life conversations. This approach required devising a novel pipeline for collecting large, high-quality neural datasets aligned with natural language production and comprehension. I combined this novel dataset with deep learning methods to examine brain dynamics during free conversations, providing a window into neuro-cognitive processes related to the production and comprehension of speech in real-life contexts. The results will show how a deep-learning framework can shed light on prediction during comprehension and on the importance of context and use of language in naturalistic environments."

		"abstract":"Little is known about how computations for multiple tasks interact within a single network of neurons because their activity is primarily studied during the performance of a single task. To investigate neural network flexibility for multiple computations, we trained biologically inspired recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform a diverse set of sensorimotor and cognitive tasks. Building on previous work that initially characterized neural representations at single snapshots in time, we found that network activity patterns are organized such that the same dynamical elements (fixed points, line attractors, etc.) can be shared across tasks that require similar computations. This property minimizes the redundancy of neural dynamics across all tasks. For example, in two category tasks, the network aligns the initial state of the dynamical system for each task such that the same region of neural state space is reused to implement the same category boundary computation. Shared dynamical components result in similar task computations operating closer together in neural state space. The particular set of tasks employed dictates which features are shared. These observations highlight the value in dynamical systems analysis for the study of neural computation."
